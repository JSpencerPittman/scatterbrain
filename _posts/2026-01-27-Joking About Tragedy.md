# Joking About Tragedy
Comedy and Tragedy have always had a very complex relationship. As a member of generation Z, I've seen my fair share of jokes about the holocaust and 9/11, truly horrendous events, however, I'll admit they were funny. I won't lie and say my virtue obstructed my ability to find the humor in the clever setups and punchlines. These weren't just jokes exchanged by cringey outcasts under the bleachers, many of them were being broadcasted to millions across america on live television.

### What determines the jokability of a situation?
For lack of vocabularly I will create the term **jokability**: the extent a subject can be joked about without causing great offense to a reasonable person.

I would say the two key variables to consider when estimating the jokability of a subject would be: *emotional attachment and intent*.

##### Emotional Attachment
I would say the less attached a person is to a subject, the arguably more jokable that very subject is. I think this is why I (struggling to not project my morals on everyone else by using the word 'we') find jokes about past tragedies funny. Regardless of the ungodliness of past events, the past is the past, and it's just simply impossible to conjure a strong attachment to that which predates us. We have limited emotional bandwidth and can't afford to give it away to such distant events, I don't believe the mind is meant to operate like that.

This also applies to events that happen after we're born and are capable of basic thought. As time passes, we gradually become more and more detached from the event. I hypothesize this is largely due to the emotional regulation that occurs during REM sleep on a nightly basis. This is why past embarassing memories lose their original sting and become comedic on reflection. This is absolutely essential to our functioning as a human. Imagine if the grief from the loss of a loved one persisted day after day, it would be absolutely debilitating. Everyone, would be stuck in a constant state of depression, anger, fear. 

*I CANNOT recommend a more intriguing book than "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker, revealing the intricacies of the most overlooked product of evolution*.

So I will argue the contrapositive of this argument would then posit that the more recent an event, the higher the jokability.

##### Intent
I did want to touch on this as, intent is very important to the jokability factor of a situation as well. When a loved one passes, we often like to tell joke about them, that paints them in a positive picture. The intent is to honor and appreciate their lives by telling engaging stories about the most baffling situations. This is despite the recency of the loss of a loved one.

Although, I argue that intent becomes less important on larger scopes. For lack of imagination maybe, I really can't think of a case where a positive intention similarly allows for joking about a national tragedy in the immediate aftermath.

### So when can we joke about national tragedy?
After the honeymoon period. The fact is, these events can be earth shattering for people's perception of how world functions. Because of this, they are very emotionally charging, and requires a decent amount of time for the public to mentally process it before, becoming detached enough to joke about it. No matter your intention, a respectable comedian should stay away from these issues for the duration of the mourning period.

### What prompted this?
I'm hesitant to start off this blog on such a contraversial issue, but I've been waiting for a push to write something and this is what I want to write about. 

Alex Pretti was killed. I'm often skeptical of the promoted virtue of a person's character that is broadcasted in these politically charged moments. But, honestly, Pretti seems like a great guy. I often don't become very emotional about these kinds of things, and instead attempt to retreat into the indifference of reason. But something about that video truly struck in me the realization of just how far this has all gone. The cold-blooded execution of a stand-up gentlemen.

Then I saw Michael Che's take on the issue for the only mention throughout the entire episode:

"""I get that ICE agents are people, allegedly, and they have a job to do. But at some point while you’re pepper-spraying old ladies or shooting at a nurse, do you ever stop to ask yourself, ‘Are we dicks?'""""

This was less than 24 hours after the incident. Honestly, I would have respected SNL if they stayed away from the issue entirely. They are a comedy show at the end of the day. If you're going to take it on, be serious. But this--this is ridiculous.

I always found the weekend update's ability to walk the line amusing, but this was too far. It's a weak and insulting approach to the issue. Normalizing the execution as "shooting at nurses," in a playful tone, as if they were playing nerf wars. Or asking "are we dicks?", instead of "are we murderers?". SNL needs to read the room. We are still in the mourning period. For the love of god, wait a week.

I probably wouldn't be as agitated if this wasn't following a sketch after the Renee incident the week prior. The previous skit jokes how this is white people's first time having to deal with injustice of this magnitude. Regardless, of the validity of this argument, this is a gross idea to propagate at a time when we as a nation need to be united. Although, I may be biased, as I suprisingly don't take well to the antagonism towards white people, as if we had it coming.

Maybe I've finally joined the cancel culture, I so detested throughout my adolescence. But I don't belive I'm asking much, when I say respect the mourning period-at least a single day.
